A somewhat radical approach to Steam chat logging

### Uses
 - SteamPP
 - luastate
 - LuaJIT
 - SteamKit
 - premake
 - libuv
 - etc...

### TODO
 - Figure out ClientFriendMsgEchoToSender packets to log both sides of conversation
 - Actual logging system

### Issues
 - Real steam client logging in to same account segfaults feidi (other way works flawlessly)
